```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## read in data

```{r}
MODL1 <- lm(SIMS~ .-ARM,data=data)
summary.lm(MODL1)
```

This first model is showing the coefficients of data type ARM. 

```{r}
MODL2 <- lm(SIMS~ .-GRIP,data=data)
summary.lm(MODL2)
```

This model of GRIP is not far off from the ARM data. The coefficients are pretty similar. 


```{r}
MODL3 <- lm(SIMS~ .- ARM+GRIP,data=data)
summary.lm(MODL3)
```


```{r}
anova(MODL1,MODL3)
```

This anova set is showing the comparison of Model 1 and Model 3. The p value is <2.2e-16. This is a very small number so we reject the hypothesis
